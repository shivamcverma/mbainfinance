            "question": "Is it possible to get a good job in banking by MBA in banking and finance?",
            "answer": "It is surely possible to enter in banking after MBA in banking and finance. The ways, you can be hired in banking sector are- IBPS exams Direct job placements by MBA colleges. Mostly every time, we don't get selected in top MBA colleges, so that we may get job placements in banks. So, the next option will be that after completing MBA from even from small MBA government college, we can try in private banks like AXIS, HDFC, ICICI through submitting our resume on banks official site at the time of recruitment. Through IBPS exam, you can choose 36 banks from a list to get hired. Some are government and some banks are private but the salary offered is same. For that preparation is must for IBPS exam. IBPS stands for Institute of Banking and Probationary officers. After MBA if you join a bank, you will be placed as an assistant manager. And after graduation if you get hired in banks, you will be placed as a probationary officer. Also, there is a one way to get hired in bank without IBPS exam. That is IIBF (Institute of banking and finance). It's a central government institute body. So, from here we can take a course of 6 months in distance mode as Diploma in banking and finance after our graduation or after MBA. After successfully completing of 6 months of diploma, they offer employment as a placement in banks. This course has two names JAIIB and Diploma in banking finance. These courses are made by government who are willing to work in banks or for promotion in banks. So enroll yourselves in IIBF as only a few people know about it. Feel free to ask. Thanks."

            "answer_text": "Yes, giving multiple MBA entrance exams like CAT, CMAT, XAT, and MAT is generally a good idea. Most of the syllabus overlaps, so your preparation works across exams, and it reduces the risk of depending on just one test.Different exams open doors to different colleges. For example, CAT is needed for IIMs, while exams like CMAT, MAT, or NMAT are accepted by many private B-schools. Colleges such as Athena School of Management also consider multiple exams and focus on the overall profile, so having more scores gives you flexibility.Overall, multiple exams simply mean more options and backup choices, which is always helpful."

            "answer_text": "I don't think the quality of MBA education is declining overall, but it's becoming very uneven. A lot more colleges have opened in the last few years, so the quality really depends on the institute you choose.Top and mid-tier B-schools still maintain good faculty, internships and placement support. But some smaller colleges don't update their curriculum or offer enough industry exposure, which makes the experience feel outdated.So it's not that MBA quality is falling everywhere — it's just important to pick a college that focuses on practical learning, internships and industry linkages rather than just classroom teaching."
